# python_on_excel
Using python libraries to perform operations on excel data.
Here the given data is in data.xlsx excel file which contains some missing values. We need to fill up those missing values with some values so that data as whole starts making more sense.

What is done ->
I have created a code_numpy.py file that operates on data.xlsx file to fill up missing values and save the result on data2.xlsx file. Missing values are filled with either mean, mode or median depending on the method user selects when the python program is run. Then standard deviation is found before and after the filling of missing values as per the method(mean, mode or median). A graph is then plotted for standard deviation vs column number (containing values).

Libraries used - 
numpy for mean and median,
scipy for mode,
matplotlib for plotting the graph,
xlrd and xlwt for reading and writing on excel file (else directly xlutils can also be used)

Important: Here excel file have been parsed and operations are the conducted. Other way could be exporting CSV file from excel and then conducting operations on the CSV file. CSV file will automatically eliminate the empty cells. :)


Results -> Fluctuations -> 

Here we have calculated the average of differences of standard deviation in all the three methods in our code to find the best suitable for filling up the missing values. This average is called as fluctuation here

For the given data, following we get -

Mean Based Method ->
fluctuation = 0.06652462870452805

Mode Based Method ->
fluctuation = 0.052384111228187

Median Based Method ->
fluctuation = 0.06458214168009144




Conclusion â€“ For the given data, fluctuation is minimal for mode based method and hence, that is the most preferred method of filling missing values of the three methods used
